# CI/CD Pipeline for Ataccama Go application

Hello! If you're reading this, you've applied to work with us as a DevOps Engineer. That's great!
As a first round of our hiring process, we want to see your technical ability. Please, read this README carefully, as it contains everything that you neeed to complete the task.

## Goal

This repository contains a little Golang application in `app` folder. You need to set up a complete end-to-end CI/CD pipeline, that will build & deploy an application on every commit to `master` branch.

You can read more about the application and it's dependencies in `app/README.md` file.

Please, clone this repo to your public GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or other git service and go on from there. After you're done, please send us link to your repository.

You can use any open-source tools to implement this CI/CD pipeline, as well as any way to package and run the application. If you'd like to have a VM or two to work on - shoot us an email, we'll deploy two instances in AWS for you.

## Evaluation criteria

The main evaluation criteria is that the CI/CD pipeline works. Application has to run somewhere and be accessible via web browser. When a change in `master` branch of repository occurs, it should automatically propagate to application.

Apart from that we will evaluate:
* tools that you've picked
* correct usage of said tools
* code readability
* solution flexibility & extensibility

## To sum up

This task is loosely-defined on purpose. With DevOps being a set of practices at best and a buzzword at worst, we want to leave you some creative freedom in how you approach this task. There is no wrong solution, apart from a solution that outright doesn't work, so don't worry about it.

Good luck, and hope to hear back from you soon!
